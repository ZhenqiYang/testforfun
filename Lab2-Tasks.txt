Lab2 will closely follow the Lecture4 slides on Moodle and the Jupyter Notebook provided and named 
Lab2-Notebook-Examples-GettingData.ipynb.
The goal of Lab2 is to practice downloading data from the Internet in different formats 
and doing some initial work with the data.

Tasks:
--- 
Topic1: Getting data from a Web URL
1. Download a file for each data format listed here (.txt, .csv, .json, .pdf, .xml, .html) using the Python library “requests”. 
2. Use specific libraries and tools for reading the content of each data format.
3. Print out the content in a user friendly format.

Topic2: Crawling data from the Web.
1. Use wget to download a few files from Wikipedia or Project Gutenberg.
2. Use wget to download a few books (.pdf files) from Kdnuggets.


Topic3: Getting data via APIs.
1. Select one public API from the list provided in Lecture4. Download a dataset from the API.
Practice using the CSV and JSON formats.
2. Extract different subfields from the dataset (using the “pandas” or “json” Python library).
